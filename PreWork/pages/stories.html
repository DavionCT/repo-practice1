	<h1>Hi, I'm Davion<h/1>
		<h3>About me</h3>
		<p>As far as my hobbies go I mainly enjoy going out and traveling with my family and playing video games when if I am home. Recently we have just begun taking up cruising as something that we all really enjoy and have been on about 2 so far in the last year. Once to the Bahamas and the second one we went to Mexico. Both trips we felt were amazing and would love to continue. When I am home though I really enjoy playing video games with my friends. Like many others it mainly consists of Call of Duty, but I recently started playing a game called Multiverse and have enjoyed it for the most part. Since I do not really watch tv or movies that often unless its kid shows with my daughter, I would have to say that my favorite movie has to be Collateral Beauty starring Will Smith.The title alone made me interested however once I watched it even though it is not the best movie I really enjoyed the overall message behind it. To take what life throws at you and not be dragged down into depression over it, but to make something good come out of it no matter how much it may hurt you.</h1>
